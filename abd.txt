Requirement is to get all the apis from our document/code and see if any contract changes on the API in new releases of SCM , if any changes are there then notify team or make the necesscery changes and raise a PR may be for 2nd phase
    It should support backward compatiability also
    Write some test case in the PR so it will check for old and new version, so if we fix something for new release it should not break old one
 
points that we need to cover -
    API - any contract changes
    Feature - ADO - visible rule
    Env. variable change and if we are using those
    Rule change - like Action enabled , runner
 
Question - How to get all the APIs that we are using already - Automated scanning of codebase to identify all SCM API calls
                It will be better if we can get the exact values we are using for those API - is it required for now ?
    Which all SCM versions we are supporting - atleast we need the min and max version
    When to run this model , we should do it as part/before of PR
    How will we be notified when SCM releases new versions? - Webhook, scheduled checks, vendor notifications CI/CD integration to automatically detect API changes
 
 
Steps we can follow -
    API/Feature/Env/Rule Discovery & Inventory -
        Get our API and contract we are expecting from our code
    Change Detection -
        Implement SCM version monitoring
        API from new SCM Version
    Testing Framework -
        Build backward compatibility test suite
        Implement multi-version testing
        Set up automated PR generation (may be for future)
    Documentation Changes -
